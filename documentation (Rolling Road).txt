-Pressing play-
By pressing play you can see the player running on a long endless plane. You can
inspect the plane being infinitely generated as well as the last 2 planes
behind the player de-spawning as they go out of view in the scene menu while
the game is running.

-changing speeds-
You can change the speed at which the plane moves by going to 
assets > prefabs > GroundTile and selecting the Automove script and changing
the variable 'speed' in the inspector. I'd reccomend using minus values as the
plane must move backwards of the players position to create the illustration of
movement.

I have not coded the ability for the player to move, the scene is only used to
display the use of the infinite ground spawner script mechanics.

Thank you
