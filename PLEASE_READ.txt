Please read before opening files.

I have uploaded only the assets folder to reduce the size of the project. It contains all the items needed for my project, 
please create a new unity project and drag the assets folder into the assets section, to open the projet. You will also find the scripts,
characters, assets, prefabs there too.

Thank you
Inayah
